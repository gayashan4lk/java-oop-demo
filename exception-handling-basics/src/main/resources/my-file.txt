✅ Maven Advantages:
Simple and predictable — strong conventions reduce confusion.
Widespread adoption — more documentation, community support.
Great for enterprise projects that prefer stability.
Easy integration with IDEs like IntelliJ, Eclipse.
❌ Maven Drawbacks:
XML syntax is verbose and not very flexible.
Harder to create custom build logic.
Slower build times.
✅ Gradle Advantages:
Faster — supports incremental builds, caching, and parallel execution.
Flexible and modern — you can mix declarative and scripted logic.
Supports both Java and Android (the default for Android).
Readable build scripts (especially with Kotlin DSL).
❌ Gradle Drawbacks:
More complex for beginners.
Custom build logic can get hard to debug.
Less predictable than Maven if not well-structured.
